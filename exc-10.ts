// Adding Comments:
// Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t
// have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name
// and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the
// program does.

const num1: number = 5;
const num2: number = 10;

// These numbers are added together (This is Comment for Exercise)

console.log (num1 + num2);
